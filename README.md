POA-Delta is a decentralized POA.NETWORK exchange where you can sell your tokens which have been deployed on the CORE.POA.NETWORK for native POA. This works exactly the same as forkdelta, only the contract has been re-deployed onto the sidechain. Native POA are bridged betweenb CORE.POA.NETWORK and the Ethereum Mainnet coming out on the other side as a ERC-20 Token. POA offers unlimited scalability and low cost of transactions(gas). 


# What is POA-Delta?
POA-Delta currently acts as an open source fork of forkdelta, which has a updated interface for EtherDelta's smart contract deployed inside the CORE.POA.NETWORK.


# How does POA-Delta Work?
POA-Delta is a decentralized POA.NETWORK exchange where you can sell your tokens which have been deployed on the CORE.POA.NETWORK for native POA. This is a Decentralized exchange meaning there is no middle man. You trade your tokens directly with someone else.

# Contribute
We welcome contributions from the community. You can contribute by improving the code, documentation, or by donating. 
ForkDelta currently interfaces with EtherDelta's original smart contract which allows ForkDelta users to trade utilizing EtherDelta's volume. However, this means that the trading fees still go to EtherDelta and ForkDelta development costs come entirely out of our pockets. If you are interested in the ForkDelta project and would like to contribute to its future, please consider donating to the following Ethereum address: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</a>

As this is a project by the community, for the community, transactions to and from the donations address will be public and can be viewed on the blockchain. We will also keep a public ledger of how the donations are distributed. That way, donors can see exactly how their donations are helping!
